Clibana
===============


Clibana is small `Clojure`_ based library that serves to programmatically create documents that represent `kibana`_ (version 4) objects.
This is, using Clibana's (hopefully) fluent API, you can create documents that will represent Kibana's saved search,
visualization, or dashboard objects. Also, as Kibana is all about searching stuff, API to define query is also available.
To open specific Kibana object in the browser, possibly with extra parameters, API for building Kibana URL's is here as well.

Clibana can be used both in Clojure and ClojureScript!
